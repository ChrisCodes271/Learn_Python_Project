Follow along with me as I complete BroCodes 12 hour Python Course. (Located Here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKHEtdqhLK8)

After finishing my degree, I felt I had spent so much time drinking from the firehose in C#.
I wanted a nice lengthy run with the basics, and figured challenging myself in a new language would be just the way to do it.
Along the way my goal is to create this one stop shop repository with all of my old notes on concepts that span from variables, to multiprocessing!
